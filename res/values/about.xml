        <p>
            AirCasting is a platform for recording, mapping, and sharing health and environmental data using your
            smartphone. Each AirCasting session lets you capture real-world measurements, annotate the data to tell
            your story, and share it via the CrowdMap.
        </p>

        <p>
            Using the AirCasting Android app, AirCasters can record, map, and share:
            <ul>
            <li>Sound levels recorded by their phone microphone</li>
            <li>Temperature, humidity, carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) gas concentrations recorded by the Arduino-powered AirCasting Air Monitor</li>
            <li>Heart rate measurements recorded by the Zephyr HxM</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Using AirCasting Luminescence, these sensor streams can also be represented using LED lights.
        </p>

        <p>
            To start recording, mapping, and sharing sound level data for your neighborhood, simply press record.

        AirCasting Luminescence uses a IOIO microcontroller connected to the AirCasting app over Bluetooth to illuminate
        LEDs in response to the sensor measurements received by the AirCasting app: green for low intensity, then yellow,
        then orange, and red for high intensity. AirCasting Luminescence was developed to communicate sensor measurements
        without the normally required reference to a screen interface and to spark interaction between AirCasters
         and people located in their immediate vicinity.
         Download the <a href="http://www.habitatmap.org/habitatmap_docs/MakeYourOwnAirCastingLuminescentApparel.pdf">AirCasting Luminescent Apparel DIY guide</a> to make
         a fashion statement with your sensor measurements.

          It’s simple to connect your own custom-designed sense device to the AirCasting app to display and record sensor measurements. Just do the following:
          <ul>
          <li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/LunarLogicPolska/AirCastingAndroidClient/blob/master/arduino/aircasting/air¬casting_tmp36.ino">AirCasting Arduino sketch</a>, which controls the sensors and sends data to the app via Bluetooth.</li>
          <li>Alter the Arduino sketch to communicate your sensor data.</li>
          <li>Use the AirCasting app to send your data to the AirCasting servers for display on the AirCasting website. Want to send the data to your own servers? Just specify the URL in the AirCasting app settings, “Menu” > “Settings” > “Backend settings”.</li>

    <![CDATA[
      <p>
      The AirCasting app can connect to external devices via Bluetooth. Currently supported devices include
      1) sensor packages, such as the <a href="http://www.habitatmap.org/habitatmap_docs/HowToBuildAnAirCastingAirMonitor.pdf">AirCasting Air Monitor</a>, whose communications conform to the format defined in the
      <a href="https://github.com/LunarLogicPolska/AirCastingAndroidClient/blob/master/arduino/aircasting/air¬casting_tmp36.ino">AirCasting Arduino</a> sketch 2) the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10748">IOIO microcontroller</a>, which powers AirCasting Luminescence and
      3) the <a href="http://www.zephyr-technology.com/products/fitness">Zephyr HxM</a> heart rate monitor.
      </p>
      <p>
      To connect to an external device navigate to the settings screen, press “External devices”, press “pair with new devices”, scan for the device, select the device, enter the pairing code (“1234” for the AirCasting Air Monitor and Zephyr HxM, “4545” for the IOIO), return to the AirCasting app, press the name of the device, and when prompted to connect press “Yes”. You normally only need to pair with a device once, however, in the case of the IOIO you’ll need to pair whenever prompted by pulling down the window shade, pressing the pairing request, and entering "4545".

        <p>
            AirCasting provides four ways to view your sensor data: the Route Map, the CrowdMap, the Graph, and the Sensors Dashboard. Toggle between views by tapping the triangular buttons located on the left and right sides of the screen. If you don’t see any buttons, tap the screen once to make them appear; tap the screen again to make them disappear.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Route Map displays your current position as a colored dot with a white outline; dots without an outline are past readings. A dot’s color corresponds to the reading’s intensity at a location. Refer to the “Heat Legend ” (the colored bar at the top of the screen) to identify the intensity range for a reading. For example, a yellow dot corresponds to a sound level reading between 61 and 70 decibels. To toggle between sensor streams tap the “Avg” “Now” “Peak” circles at the top of the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            The CrowdMap displays AirCasting data from all contributors. Each square’s color corresponds to the average intensity of all the readings recorded in that area. Refer to the “Heat Legend ” to identify the intensity range for a square. For example, an orange square corresponds to an average sound level between 71 and 80 decibels. If no colors are displayed, there is no data in that area.
        </p>
        <p>
           The Graph displays your readings over time. Zoom in and out for more or less detail, swipe to pan through the data.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Sensors Dashboard displays the measurements from all your sensor streams simultaneously. Tap the record buttons next to each sensor stream to toggle recording off/on. Tap the eye icon to select that sensor stream for viewing on the Route Map, CrowdMap, and Graph.

If you have access to a sound level meter, compare the readings with those from your phone, and then adjust the “microphone maximum” until the readings on your phone match those from the sound level meter.
