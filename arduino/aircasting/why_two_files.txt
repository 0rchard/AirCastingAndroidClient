You're probably wondering, why there are two files with almost the same code
available: answer is pretty simple, there are multiple types of sensors
in real world.

File ending with lm335a uses that sensor for temperature, the one with tmp36..
I'm sure you get me :-) The only important difference in the code is function
that actually calculates the temperature is different for both sensors. Rest
of the code is basically the same.
